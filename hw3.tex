\problem{}%1
 Consider two topologies on $\R$:  the Euclidean (or usual) topology $\T_E$, and the topology $\T_{CF}$ in which the \emph{closed} sets are $\R$ and all the finite subsets of $\R$.
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 	
 	\item Suppose $f:(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_E)$ is continuous.  Prove that it is also continuous as a map $(\R,\T_E) \to (\R,\T_{CF})$.
 	
 	\item Give an example of  a continuous map $g:(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_{CF})$ that is \emph{not} continuous as a map $(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_E)$.
 	
 	\emph{Suggestion}:  Try strictly increasing piecewise linear maps.
 	
 	\item Find all continuous maps $f:(\R,\T_{CF})\to (\R,\T_E)$.
 \end{enumerate}

Let $f: (\R,\T_E)\to(\R,\T_{CF})$. $f$ is continuous iff $\forall U \subset \R$ when $U$ closed in $\T_{CF} \implies f^{-1}(U)$ is closed in $\T_E$.
Let \begin{equation}U = \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{N} x_i \end{equation} be a closed set in the topology $\T_{CF}$, then this set is also closed in $\T_E$ because a single point $x_i$ is closed and the closed sets are closed under finite union. The mapping $f:(\R,\T_E)\to(\R,\T_E)$ is continuous $\implies f^{-1}(U)$ is closed, thus $f$ is continuous. 

\part{}
A continuous map $g:(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_{CF})$ that is \emph{not} continuous as $(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_E)$ is \begin{equation}g(x) = \begin{cases} x & x\le 0 \\ x+1 & x >0 \end{cases}\end{equation} 
This map is continuous $\T_E \to \T_{CF}$ as the preimage of any finite set of points (which is closed in $\T_{CF}$) is closed in $\T_E$:
\begin{gather}
\text{Let } U= \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{N} x_i\\
f^{-1}(U) = \left\{ \bigcup x_i \;\forall x_i \le 0 \right\} \cup \left\{\bigcup x_i+1 \; \forall x_i > 0\right\}
\end{gather}
where $x_i\in\R$, thus the preimage in $\T_E$ is a finite union of closed sets, which is also closed.

$g:(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_E)$ is \emph{not} continuous because the preimage of a $\T_E$-closed set is not $\T_E$-closed:
\begin{gather}
\text{Let } U= \left[\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right]\\
f^{-1}(U) = \left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right]
\end{gather}
This preimage is not $\T_E$-closed, so the map is not continuous, because a map is continuous iff the preimage of every closed set is closed.

These diagrams illustrate these cases:

Note that for this $g$, $g^{-1}\big((1,2]\big)=\emptyset$, which is still closed.

\problem{} %2
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $(X,\T_X)$ and $(Y,\T_Y)$ be topological spaces let $f,g:(X,\T_X)\to(Y,\T_Y)$ be continuous maps, and suppose that $(Y,\T_Y)$ is Hausdorff.   Prove that
	$$
	E(f,g) = \{x\in X \  | \  f(x) = g(x) \}
	$$
	is \emph{closed} in $(X,\T_X)$.
	\item Give an example of two continuous maps $f,g$ with $E(f,g)$ not closed.  (If possible, try to find an example with $(X,\T_X)$ 
	Hausdorff.)
\end{enumerate}

\solution{}

\part{}
Suppose $f(x) \neq g(x)$, because $Y$ is Hausdorff $\exists\: U = \text{nbd } \text{of } f(x),\; V=\text{nbd } \text{of } g(x)$ where $U\cap V=\emptyset$. The preimages of these open sets remain open as $f,g$ continuous, and since they both contain $x$: $f^{-1}(U),\:g^{-1}(V)\subset X$ are open nbds of $x$. Let $W=f^{-1}(U)\cap g^{-1}(V) \implies x\in W$. $W$ is still open as $\T_X$ is closed under finite intersection. These $x$ are such that $f(x)\neq g(x)$, so they are in the complement of $E$: $x\in W\subset E^{\mathsf{c}} \implies E^{\mathsf{c}} \text{ open } \implies E \text{ closed}$.

\problem{}%3
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, let $x\in X$ and let $A\subset X$ be non-empty.  Define the \emph{distance between $x$ and $A$}, denoted $d(x,A)$, by
$$
d(x,A) = \inf \{d(x,y)\  | \  y\in A\}.
$$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that $d(x,A)$ is a continuous function of $x$. 
	
	\emph{Suggestion}:  Prove more: it is a Lipschitz function, with Lipschitz constant $1$.
	
	\item Prove that $d(x,A) = 0\  \Longleftrightarrow \  x\in\overline{A}$.
	
	\item Prove that, if $A$ is closed, then there exists a continuous function $f:X\to\R$ so that $ A = \{x\in X | f(x) = 0\}$.
	
	\item Suppose $A,B\subset X$ are \emph{closed} sets, non-empty, and \emph{disjoint}: $A\cap B = \emptyset$. Prove that there exists a contiuous function $g:X\to [0,1]$ such that 
	$$
	g(x) = 0 \Longleftrightarrow x\in A \hbox{ and } g(x) = 1 \Longleftrightarrow x\in B.
	$$
	
	\emph{Suggestion}: Experiment with  functions with $d(x,A) + d(x,B)$ as denominator.
	
	\item Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, non-empty, closed sets as above, there exist open sets $U,V\subset X$ so that $A\subset U, B\subset V$ and $U\cap V = \emptyset$.
\end{enumerate}

\solution{}
\part{}%a
To show this, let $x$ and $y$ be points in $X$ and $p$ be a point in $A$:
$$d(x,p) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,p)\ \ \ \ \text{ (triangle inequality)}$$
$$d(x,A) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,p)$$

as $d(x,A)$ is the infimum. Then:
$$ d(x,A) - d(x,y) \leq d(y,p) $$
$$ d(x,A) - d(x,y) \leq d(y,A) $$

as $d(y,A)$ is the infimum. Thus:
\begin{gather}
d(x,A) - d(y,A) \leq d(x,y) \label{eq:ineq}
\end{gather}


If we look at the definition of Lipschitz, $f$ is Lipshitz iff $d'(f(x),f(y)) \leq Cd(x,y)$. In this case $f$ is $d(x,A)$, thus:
\begin{align}
d'(f(x),f(y)) = d'(d(x,A),d(y,A)) &\leq Cd(x,y)  \nonumber\\ 
\nonumber \\
|d(x,A) - d(y,A)| &\leq Cd(x,y)\label{eq:lip}
\end{align}

In (\ref{eq:ineq}), the definition of Lipschitz, (\ref{eq:lip}), was proven with a Lipschitz constant of $C=1$.  $d(x,A)$ being Lipschitz $\implies d(x,A)$ is uniformly continuous $\implies d(x,A)$ is continuous.

\part{}%b
Let $x \in \bar{A}$. Then for any $\epsilon>0$ there exists an open ball $B_\epsilon(x)$ centered around $x$ and of radius $\epsilon$ such that $B_\epsilon(x) \cap A \neq \emptyset$. Let $y_\epsilon \in B_\epsilon(x) \cap A$. Then $d(x,A) \leq d(x,y_\epsilon) < \epsilon$, and since $\epsilon>0$ was arbitrary, it follows that $d(x,A) = \inf \{d(x,y_{\epsilon})\} = 0$.

Conversely, if $d(x,A) = 0$ then for any $\epsilon>0$ there exists $y_\epsilon \in A$ such that $d(x,y_\epsilon) < \epsilon$, and so $B_{\epsilon}(x) \cap A \neq \emptyset$. But any open ball centered at $x$ will contain $B_{\epsilon}(x)$ for some $\epsilon>0$ and hence have nonempty intersection with $A$.


\part{}%c
The distance function given satisfies these conditions for $A$ closed:
\begin{equation}
f(x) = d(x,A): X\to \R\\
\end{equation}
$f$ is continuous as shown in (a). As shown in (b), $ A = \{x\in X | f(x) = 0\}$ as A is its own closure.

\part{}%d
The proposed function exists and can be defined as
\begin{equation}
g(x)= \frac{d(x,A)}{d(x,A)+d(x,B)}
\end{equation}

To show $x\in A \implies g(x) = 0$:
\begin{gather}
\text{(b) }\implies d(x,A)=0\\
A\cap B = \emptyset \implies d(x,B)=\varepsilon, \: \varepsilon>0\\
g(x) = \frac{0}{0+\varepsilon}=0
\end{gather}

To show $x\in B \implies g(x) = 1$:
\begin{gather}
\text{(b) }\implies d(x,B)=0\\
A\cap B = \emptyset \implies d(x,A)=\varepsilon, \: \varepsilon>0\\
g(x) = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon+0}=1
\end{gather}

To show $g(x) = 0\implies x\in A $:
\begin{gather}
g(x) = 0 \implies d(x,A)=0\\
\text{(b) }\implies x\in A
\end{gather}

To show $g(x) = 1\implies x\in B $:
\begin{gather}
g(x) = 1 \implies d(x,A)=d(x,A)+d(x,B)\\
d(x,A)-d(x,A)=d(x,B)\implies d(x,B)=0 \implies x\in B
\end{gather}

\part{}%e
As $X$ is a metric space, it is metrizable, thus the topology on $X$ is Hausdorff. This allows the following constructions:
\begin{gather}
U=\bigcup\left\{ L\subset X | \forall x\in A,\: y\in B\text{ (so} x,y \in X \text{)}, \: L=\text{nbd}(x) \text{ open}, \: M=\text{nbd}(y) \text{ open, s.t. } L\cap M=\emptyset\right\}\\
V=\bigcup\left\{ M\subset X | \forall x\in A,\: y\in B\text{ (so} x,y \in X \text{)}, \: L=\text{nbd}(x) \text{ open}, \: M=\text{nbd}(y) \text{ open, s.t. } L\cap M=\emptyset\right\}
\end{gather}
so the sets never intersect and meet the conditions.
