\problem{}%1
 Consider two topologies on $\R$:  the Euclidean (or usual) topology $\T_E$, and the topology $\T_{CF}$ in which the \emph{closed} sets are $\R$ and all the finite subsets of $\R$.
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 	
 	\item Suppose $f:(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_E)$ is continuous.  Prove that it is also continuous as a map $(\R,\T_E) \to (\R,\T_{CF})$.
 	
 	\item Give an example of  a continuous map $g:(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_{CF})$ that is \emph{not} continuous as a map $(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_E)$.
 	
 	\emph{Suggestion}:  Try strictly increasing piecewise linear maps.
 	
 	\item Find all continuous maps $f:(\R,\T_{CF})\to (\R,\T_E)$.
 \end{enumerate}

Let $f: (\R,\T_E)\to(\R,\T_{CF})$. $f$ is continuous iff $\forall U \subset \R$ when $U$ closed in $\T_{CF} \implies f^{-1}(U)$ is closed in $\T_E$.
Let \begin{equation}U = \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{N} x_i \end{equation} be a closed set in the topology $\T_{CF}$, then this set is also closed in $\T_E$ because a single point $x_i$ is closed and the closed sets are closed under finite union. The mapping $f:(\R,\T_E)\to(\R,\T_E)$ is continuous $\implies f^{-1}(U)$ is closed, thus $f$ is continuous.

A continuous map $g:(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_{CF})$ that is \emph{not} continuous as $(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_E)$ is \begin{equation}g(x) = \begin{cases} x & x\le 0 \\ x+1 & x >0 \end{cases}\end{equation} 
This map is continuous $\T_E \to \T_{CF}$ as the preimage of any finite set of points (which is closed in $\T_{CF}$) is closed in $\T_E$:
\begin{gather}
\text{Let } U= \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{N} x_i\\
f^{-1}(U) = \left\{ \bigcup x_i \;\forall x_i \le 0 \right\} \cup \left\{\bigcup x_i+1 \; \forall x_i > 0\right\}
\end{gather}
where $x_i\in\R$, thus the preimage in $\T_E$ is a finite union of closed sets, which is also closed.

$g:(\R,\T_E)\to (\R,\T_E)$ is \emph{not} continuous because the preimage of a $\T_E$-closed set is not $\T_E$-closed:
\begin{gather}
\text{Let } U= \left[\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right]\\
f^{-1}(U) = \left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right]
\end{gather}
This preimage is not $\T_E$-closed, so the map is not continuous, because a map is continuous iff the preimage of every closed set is closed.

These diagrams illustrate these cases:

Note that for this $g$, $g^{-1}\big((1,2]\big)=\emptyset$, which is still closed.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $(X,\T_X)$ and $(Y,\T_Y)$ be topological spaces let $f,g:(X,\T_X)\to(Y,\T_Y)$ be continuous maps, and suppose that $(Y,\T_Y)$ is Hausdorff.   Prove that
	$$
	E(f,g) = \{x\in X \  | \  f(x) = g(x) \}
	$$
	is \emph{closed} in $(X,\T_X)$.
	\item Give an example of two continuous maps $f,g$ with $E(f,g)$ not closed.  (If possible, try to find an example with $(X,\T_X)$ 
	Hausdorff.)

\problem{}%3
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, let $x\in X$ and let $A\subset X$ be non-empty.  Define the \emph{distance between $x$ and $A$}, denoted $d(x,A)$, by
$$
d(x,A) = \inf \{d(x,y)\  | \  y\in A\}.
$$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that $d(x,A)$ is a continuous function of $x$. 
	
	\emph{Suggestion}:  Prove more: it is a Lipschitz function, with Lipschitz constant $1$.
	
	\item Prove that $d(x,A) = 0\  \Longleftrightarrow \  x\in\overline{A}$.
	
	\item Prove that, if $A$ is closed, then there exists a continuous function $f:X\to\R$ so that $ A = \{x\in X | f(x) = 0\}$.
	
	
	
	\item Suppose $A,B\subset X$ are \emph{closed} sets, non-empty, and \emph{disjoint}: $A\cap B = \emptyset$. Prove that there exists a contiuous function $g:X\to [0,1]$ such that 
	$$
	g(x) = 0 \Longleftrightarrow x\in A \hbox{ and } g(x) = 1 \Longleftrightarrow x\in B.
	$$
	
	\emph{Suggestion}: Experiment with  functions with $d(x,A) + d(x,B)$ as denominator.
	
	\item Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, non-empty, closed sets as above, there exist open sets $U,V\subset X$ so that $A\subset U, B\subset V$ and $U\cap V = \emptyset$.
