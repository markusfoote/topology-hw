Let $X$ be a topological space, give $X\times X$ the product topology, and let the \lq\lq diagonal"  $\Delta\subset X\times X$ be defined by 
$$
\Delta =\{ (x,x): x\in X\}.
$$
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Prove that $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if $\Delta$ is closed in $X\times X$.
	
	\item Use this fact to give another proof of the fact proved in a previous homework problem:  If $Z$ is another topological space, $f,g:Z\to X$ are continuous, and $X$ is Hausdorff, then
	$$
	E(f,g) = \{x\in Z \ | \ f(x) = g(x)\}
	$$ 
	is closed in $Z$.  Make sure your proof takes at most two lines.
\end{enumerate}

Suppose $X$ is Hausdorff. $\Delta^{\mathbf{c}}=\{(x,y)\ | \ x\ne y,\ x,y\in X\}$. $X$ being Hausdorff provides $U,V \mathrm{ open }\subset X$ with $x\in U$, $y\in V$. $U\times V$ is thus a basis element with $(x,y) \in U\times V$. Because $U$ and $V$ are disjoint from the Hausdorff condition, they contain no common points, so they contain nothing in $\Delta$: $U\times V \subset \Delta^{mathbf{c}}\implies \Delta^{\mathbf{c}}$ open $\implies \Delta$ closed in $X\times X$.

Suppose $\Delta$ is closed in $X\times X$. $\forall (x,y)\in \Delta^{\mathbf{c}} \exists U\times V$ basis element with $(x,y)\in U\times V \subset \Delta^{\mathbf{c}}$. $U\times V \subset \Delta^{\mathbf{c}} \implies U\cap V=\emptyset$. Any $x\ne y\in X \implies (x,y)\in \Delta^{\mathbf{c}}$ with a basis element containing $(x,y)$ which provides open, disjoint $U,\ V$ with $x\in U$, $y\in V$, thus $X$ is Hausdorff.

Give an example of a topological space $X$ and a compact subset $C\subset X$ with $C$ not closed in $X$.
\solution{}
Let $X=\left\{ 0,1\right\}$ and give this space the discrete topology $\T=\left\{ \emptyset,\ \{0\},\ \{1\},\ X\right\}$. The open subset $C=\left\{ 1\right\}$ is compact as only open cover $\B =\left\{0,1\right\}$ has the trivial finite subcover of $U_{\alpha_1}=0, U_{\alpha_2}=1$. 


\problem{}%3
Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space, and let $A,B\subset X$ be closed sets which are  disjoint : $A\cap B =\emptyset$.  Prove that there are open sets $U,V\subset X$ with $A\subset U$, $B\subset V$, and $U\cap V = \emptyset$. 

\solution{}
Let $b\in B$. For each $a\in A,\ U_a\ni a,\ V_a\ni b$ open s.t. $U_a \cap V_a=\emptyset$. The collection of $U_a$ form an open cover of $A$, which implies a finite subcover $U_{a_1},\ldots,U_{a_n}$.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $(X,\T)$ be a topological space and let $\B$ be a basis for $\T$.  Prove that $(X,\T)$ is compact if and only if every cover of $X$ by elements of $\B$ has a finite sub-cover. 
	\item Let $X$ and $Y$ be compact topological spaces and let $X\times Y$ be their product, with the product topology.   Prove that $X\times Y$ is compact.
	
\end{enumerate}

First assume X is compact then take a covering of X by members of B since each member of B is open we have a open covering of X, then because X is compact the covering by members of B have a finite subcovering.

Second assume every covering by members of B have a finite subcovering. Take a open covering of X call it \{U_{\alpha},\alpha \in A\}, by definition each U_\alpha is union of elements of B, then take set formed for all the elements of B which are contained in some U_\alpha. By definition this set is a open covering of X by elements of B, then it have a finite subcovering B_1,B_2,...,B_n each one contained in at least one element of \{U_{\alpha},\alpha \in A\}, for each B_i,i=1..n pick U_i,i=1..n with the property B_i \subset U_i, then U_1,U_2,...,U_n is a finite subcovering of X (because B_1,B_2,...,B_n it is)

Yeah, maybe rewrite that....

We have seen that the Cantor set can be described as the set $\{0,2\}^\N$ of infinite sequences of zeros and twos, which is in bijective correspondence with the more convenient set $\{0,1\}^\N$ of infinite sequences of zeros and ones.  This choice has  the advantage that $\{0,1\}$ can be  naturally identified with $\Z/2$, the integers modulo two, which forms a group under addition:  $ 0 + 0 = 1+ 1 = 0, 0+1 = 1+ 0 = 1$.  In this way the Cantor set becomes a group, by pointwise addition of sequences: $\{a_i\} + \{b_i\} = \{a_i + b_i \}$.  

\emph{ Prove that this operation is continuous}. This means that the  addition  map
$$
A: \{0,1\}^\N\times\{0,1\}^\N \to \{0,1\}^\N 
$$
defined by
$$
A(\{a_1,a_2,\dots, a_i,\dots  \},\{b_1,b_2,\dots, b_i,\dots\})  = \{a_1 + b_1, a_2+b_2,\dots , a_i +b_i,\dots \}
$$
is continuous, where $\{0,1\}^\N$ is given the (infinite) product topology, and $\{0,1\}^\N\times\{0,1\}^\N$ the product (two factors) of the infinite product topologies in each factor.

\emph{Suggestion}:  Fix $i_0\in\N$, and  fix an open set $U\subset \{0,1\}$ (so  $U $ is one of $\emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\},\{0,1\}$).  The sets $A^{-1}(\{ \{a_i\} \ | \ a_{i_0}\in U\})$ form a sub-basis (see notes, v1,  3.4.3)  for the topology of $\{0,1\}^\N$, so it is enough to show that $A^{-1}(\{ \{a_i\} \ | \ a_{i_0}\in U\})$ is open.
